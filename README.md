# CropYield
Crop yield prediction is an important agricultural problem. The Agricultural yield primarily depends on weather conditions (rain, temperature, etc), pesticides. Accurate information about the history of crop yield is important for making decisions related to agricultural risk management and future predictions. 

Predicting the crop yield in advance of its harvest would help the policy makers and farmers for taking appropriate measures for marketing and storage.
